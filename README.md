# Wine Properties Classification with Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project is part of my computer science degree, demonstrating the application of machine learning techniques on the wine dataset. The project focuses on the classification of wine properties using feature engineering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

## Dataset

The wine dataset used in this project contains various chemical properties of wine samples. The features include attributes like acidity, sugar content, pH level, alcohol percentage, and more. The goal is to classify the wine properties based on these features.

## Techniques Used

- **Feature Engineering**: Various techniques are applied to transform raw data into meaningful features for machine learning models.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: PCA is used to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, improving computational efficiency and potentially model performance.
- **Classification Models**: Several classification algorithms are used, including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests, to predict wine properties.
